# üöÄ IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

## Step 1: Deploy to Railway.app (5 minutes)

1. **Create GitHub Repository**
   ```bash
   # If you haven't already, push to GitHub:
   cd /Users/1arijits/PROFESSIONAL/deepl_mcp
   # Create a new repository on GitHub named 'deepl-mcp-professional'
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/deepl-mcp-professional.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

   - Click "Deploy Now"

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - In Railway dashboard, go to your project

     ```
     DEEPL_API_KEY = 09d1702b-d2e4-47d6-b74d-1fded50b0463:fx
     ```
   - Railway automatically sets the PORT variable

4. **Get Your Deployment URL**
   - Railway will provide a URL like: `https://deepl-mcp-professional-production.up.railway.app`

## Step 2: Configure Airia (2 minutes)

Once deployed, use these **EXACT** details in Airia:

### üìã Airia Connection Details:

- **Token**: `mcp_token_professional_airia_deepl_2024`

### üéØ Step-by-Step Airia Setup:

1. In Airia interface, click "Add MCP Server" or the "+" button
2. Select "Connect to Custom MCP Server" 
3. Fill in the form:
   - **URL**: `https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.up.railway.app/sse`

   - **Token**: `mcp_token_professional_airia_deepl_2024`
4. Leave other fields as default
5. Click "Connect MCP Server"

## ‚úÖ Verification

Your server should now:
- ‚úÖ Be running 24/7 on Railway
- ‚úÖ Accept connections from Airia  
- ‚úÖ Provide translation tools
